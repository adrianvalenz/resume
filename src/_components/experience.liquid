  <p class="text-sm leading-snug">
  Came on for a bit to help the crew focus on an area of the app that needed to get done but their
  attention was demanded elsewhere by other more pressing priorities. I was happy to help them incorporate
  a complex form for a model that utilized Hotwire and StimulusJS. We used Hotwire and Turbo Frames to swap out
  the input fields with the rendered data after being updated. The form lived in an HTML element slider that was
  powered by Stimulus. 

  <ul class="list-square px-4 py-4 text-sm font-semibold">
    <li>Designed a new look for the app with a fresh color palette and typography enhancements</li>
    <li>Designed a new UI with the forms and ensured typography and elements were all cohesive, balanced, and complemented eachother</li>
    <li>Code the design using TailwindCSS on the front end with standard Rails views.</li>
    <li>Ensure CSS dimensions were properly placed so when the HTML was swapped in the Turbo Frames it did not misalign the UI or affect
      other functionality</li>
  </ul>
